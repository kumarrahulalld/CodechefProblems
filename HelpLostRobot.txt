All submissions for this problem are available.
Robot Bunny is lost. It wants to reach its home as soon as possible. Currently it is standing at coordinates (x1, y1) in 2-D plane. Its home is at coordinates (x2, y2). Bunny is extremely worried. Please help it by giving a command by telling the direction in which it should to go so as to reach its home. If you give it a direction, it will keep moving in that direction till it reaches its home. There are four possible directions you can give as command - "left", "right", "up", "down". It might be possible that you can't instruct the robot in such a way that it reaches its home. In that case, output "sad".

Input
First line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow.

First line of each test case contains four space separated integers x1, y1, x2, y2.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing "left" or "right" or "up" or "down" or "sad" (without quotes).

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 5000
0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2. ≤ 100
It's guaranteed that the initial position of robot is not his home.
Example
Input
3
0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1
0 0 1 1

Output:
right
up
sad
Explanation
Test case 1. If you give Bunny the command to move to the right, it will reach its home.

Code:-

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--)
	{
	    int a,b,c,d;
	    cin>>a>>b>>c>>d;
	    if(c!=a&&d!=b)
	    cout<<"sad";
	    else
	    {
	        if(c>a)
	        cout<<"right";
	        else if(d>b)
	        cout<<"up";
	        else if(c<a)
	        cout<<"left";
	        else if(d<b)
	        cout<<"down";
	    }
	    cout<<endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
